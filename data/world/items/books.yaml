  - id: book_fae_creatures
    name: "Creatures of the Fae"
    description: |
      A worn leather-bound tome titled 'Creatures of the Fae: A Scholar's Account'.
      The pages are yellowed with age, and some passages have been scratched out.

      Reading this book reveals the following text:

      The Fae realm exists alongside our own, separated by a barrier that grows
      thin in certain places - most notably the standing stones known as
      waystones or greystones. These ancient monuments were not built by human
      hands, and their true purpose remains unknown.

      Within the Fae, time flows differently. A traveler might spend what feels
      like hours there, only to return and find days have passed. Or the
      reverse may occur - years in the Fae passing as mere moments in our world.

      The creatures of Fae are varied and dangerous. The Sithe are hunters who
      guard against certain threats. They are deadly beyond mortal reckoning,
      and wise travelers give them wide berth.

      Note: Several pages appear to have been torn from this section.

  - id: book_cthaeh_warning
    name: "The Oracle's Shadow"
    description: |
      A thin journal bound in black leather. The cover bears no title, but
      someone has written 'DO NOT READ' in red ink across the front page.
      The ink has faded to brown with age.

      Reading this book reveals the following text:

      I write this as a warning to any who follow my path. The Cthaeh exists.
      I have spoken with it, and I am already dead because of that choice.

      It is called many things - the Oracle, the Rhinna-tree, the Shadow of
      All Things. It speaks only truth. Every word it says is absolutely,
      provably true. This is its curse. This is why it is so dangerous.

      The Cthaeh cannot lie, but it can choose which truths to speak. It sees
      all possible futures and knows exactly which words will cause the most
      harm. When it tells you the truth, it is telling you the precise truth
      that will lead you to ruin.

      The Sithe exist to prevent the Cthaeh's influence from spreading. They
      kill anyone who speaks with it. They are not cruel - they are trying
      to prevent catastrophe. If you have spoken to the Cthaeh, they will
      hunt you. Accept this. You are already a plague carrier.

      Some say the Cthaeh offers gifts - power, knowledge, strength. These
      gifts are real. The power it grants is genuine. But the price...

      The final pages are blank, as if the author never finished writing.

  - id: book_sithe_history
    name: "The Silent Hunters"
    description: |
      An ancient scroll preserved between two thin wooden boards. The
      script is written in a flowing hand that predates modern calligraphy.

      Reading this scroll reveals the following text:

      The Sithe are the guardians of the Cthaeh's prison. They have watched
      the twisted tree since before the creation of the Fae realm itself,
      or so the oldest stories claim.

      They are not Fae, though they dwell in the Fae realm. They are not
      human, though they wear human form. They are something older, bound
      to a single purpose: to ensure that the Cthaeh's poison does not spread.

      When someone speaks with the Cthaeh, the Sithe follow. They do not
      always kill immediately - sometimes they wait, watching. But they
      always kill eventually. There are no exceptions. There is no mercy.
      There is only the prevention of catastrophe.

      Some scholars argue that the Sithe's vigilance is excessive. After all,
      they say, what harm can words do? These scholars have never spoken
      with the Cthaeh.

      The Sithe carry bows of a wood that does not grow in any forest, mortal
      or Fae. Their arrows never miss. Their patience is infinite.

      If you see a Sithe, turn back. If a Sithe speaks to you, obey.
      If a Sithe raises a bow against you, pray that death comes swiftly.

  - id: book_greystones
    name: "Of Standing Stones and Twilight"
    description: |
      A slim volume with a silver-tooled cover depicting a ring of standing
      stones beneath a twilight sky. The University seal is embossed on
      the spine.

      Reading this book reveals the following text:

      The greystones - also called waystones, oldstones, or doorstones - are
      found throughout the Commonwealth and beyond. They predate all known
      civilizations and are constructed of a stone not found in any quarry.

      At twilight, when the world stands between day and night, the space
      between certain stones grows thin. A traveler who knows the way - or
      who stumbles through by accident - may find themselves in the Fae realm.

      The Fae is not a separate world but a shadow of our own, or perhaps we
      are a shadow of it. The twilight forest stretches endlessly in all
      directions, lit by a sky that knows neither sun nor moon.

      Returning from the Fae requires finding the shimmer between worlds.
      This is easier for some than others. Time spent searching in the Fae
      passes differently in the mortal world - sometimes faster, sometimes
      slower. Those who become lost rarely return.

      The University officially denies the existence of the Fae realm. This
      book was banned from the Archives in 423 LD.

  - id: book_chandrian_signs
    name: "The Book of Secrets"
    description: |
      A tiny book, no larger than a hand, bound in red leather. The pages
      are tissue-thin and covered in cramped, fearful handwriting.

      Reading this book reveals the following text:

      Do not speak their names. Do not seek them. Do not even think of them
      overmuch, for they may feel your thoughts and come.

      But if you must know - if you must defend yourself - here are the signs:

      Cyphus bears the blue flame.
      Stercus is in thrall of iron.
      Ferule chill and dark of eye.
      Usnea lives in nothing but decay.
      Grey Dalcenti never speaks.
      Pale Alenta brings the blight.
      Last there is the lord of seven:
      Hated. Hopeless. Sleepless. Sane.

      The Cthaeh knows their secrets. The Cthaeh knows their weaknesses.
      The Cthaeh could tell you how to find them, how to hurt them, how to
      destroy them.

      But the Cthaeh's help is worse than their wrath. Trust me. I know.

      The rest of the pages are blank, but there are faint water stains
      that might have been tears.

  # General lore books
  - id: book_university_history
    name: "A History of the University"
    description: |
      A thick tome with the University seal embossed in gold on the cover.
      The pages are crisp and well-maintained.

      Reading this book reveals the following text:

      The University was founded over two thousand years ago, though its
      exact origins are lost to history. It stands as the greatest center
      of learning in the Four Corners of Civilization.

      The University is governed by the Masters, nine scholars of immense
      knowledge and power. They oversee the various disciplines:

      - Master Lorren: The Archives
      - Master Kilvin: The Artificery
      - Master Arwyl: The Medica
      - Master Elodin: Naming (formerly of the Rookery)
      - Master Hemme: Rhetoric and Logic
      - Master Elxa Dal: Sympathy
      - Master Mandrag: Alchemy
      - Master Brandeur: Arithmetic
      - Chancellor Herma: Administration

      Admission to the University requires passing an examination before
      all nine Masters. Tuition varies based on the Masters' assessment
      of the student's ability - more talented students pay less.

      The Arcanum is the highest level of study, open only to those who
      have proven themselves worthy. Its secrets are not discussed in
      this general history.

  - id: book_sympathy_primer
    name: "Sympathy: A Primer"
    description: |
      A well-worn textbook with numerous marginal notes in different hands.
      The cover shows a pair of linked objects.

      Reading this book reveals the following text:

      Sympathy is the art of making one thing similar to another through
      the power of belief and will. At its heart is the principle of
      similarity: two things that share properties can be linked.

      The Three Laws of Sympathy:

      1. The Doctrine of Correspondence: Similarity enhances sympathy.
         The more alike two things are, the stronger the link.

      2. The Principle of Consanguinity: Part of a thing can represent
         the whole. A drop of blood contains the essence of the person.

      3. The Law of Conservation: Energy cannot be created or destroyed,
         only transferred. All sympathetic links have loss.

      To perform sympathy, one must:
      - Establish a link between two objects
      - Split the mind to maintain the connection (the Alar)
      - Direct energy through the link

      Warning: Drawing too much energy can cause binder's chills.
      Extreme overexertion can be fatal.
