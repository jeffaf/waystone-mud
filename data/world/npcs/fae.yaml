      The Cthaeh is not truly visible - it exists within the tree, a presence
      felt more than seen. Yet you can sense its attention, vast and cold and
      utterly alien. It has watched the turning of ages, seen empires rise
      and crumble to dust. It knows everything that will happen, every choice
      you will make, every consequence that will unfold.

      And it wants to talk to you.

      The butterflies that swirl around the tree - red and black, beautiful
      and terrible - are said to be the only company the Cthaeh has kept for
      millennia. The Sithe, the hunters of the Fae, kill anyone who speaks
      with it. They believe its words are a poison that spreads through fate
      itself.

      Perhaps they are right.

      greeting: |
        A voice drifts from the tree, soft as falling leaves, sharp as broken glass.
        "Ah. Another seeker of truth. How... delightful."

        curse: "Curse? No, no. I offer only... clarity. A gift, really. Would you refuse a gift?"
        truth: "I speak only truth. That is my nature. That is my prison. Every word I say is true. Every word I say brings ruin. Choose which matters more to you."
        gift: "I can give you power. The strength to overcome your enemies. All I ask in return is... service. Small tasks. Nothing you wouldn't do anyway, given enough time."
        sithe: "Ah, the Sithe. My jailers. They kill anyone who speaks with me, you know. They're watching us now, arrows nocked. But they won't shoot. Not yet. Not until you leave."
        fae: "This realm? A shadow of your world. Or perhaps your world is a shadow of this one. It's hard to tell, from where I sit."
        chandrian: "The Chandrian... yes, I know of them. Would you like me to tell you their secrets? Their signs? Their weaknesses? I could, you know. But you haven't asked the right question yet."
        help: "Help? I am always helpful. That is the cruelest truth of all."

    description: |
      The Sithe are the hunters of the Fae, ancient and deadly beyond mortal
      reckoning. This one watches you with eyes like chips of winter ice, an
      arrow nocked and ready. It makes no move to attack, but you sense it
      could loose that arrow faster than thought.

      The Sithe exist to prevent the Cthaeh's influence from spreading. They
      kill anyone who speaks with the oracle. If you have spoken with the
      Cthaeh and try to leave... this one will try to stop you.
