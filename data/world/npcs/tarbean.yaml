    description: |
      A rough character with scarred knuckles and cold, calculating eyes.
      This thug makes a living preying on the weak in Tarbean's dark alleys,
      taking whatever they can from travelers foolish enough to wander alone.
      Their clothes are stained and worn, and they smell of cheap ale and
      desperation. Violence is second nature to them.

    description: |
      A seasoned street enforcer who has survived years in Tarbean's brutal
      underworld. Multiple scars cross their face and arms, each telling a
      story of violence. They carry themselves with the confidence of someone
      who's killed before and won't hesitate to do it again. Their equipment
      is better maintained than most street thugs - this one knows their trade.

    description: |
      A dock laborer with arms like tree trunks from years of hauling cargo.
      Their hands are calloused and strong enough to crack skulls. While not
      inherently criminal, the hard life of the docks has made them quick to
      anger and quicker to violence. They smell of sweat, salt water, and tar.
      Cross them wrong and you'll learn why dockworkers are feared in tavern
      brawls across the port.

    description: |
      A member of one of Tarbean's organized crime families. Unlike common
      street thugs, this criminal belongs to a structured gang that controls
      territory along the waterfront. They wear their gang's colors openly,
      confident in the protection and reputation it provides. Their knife is
      well-maintained and they move with practiced efficiency. Cross one of
      them and you cross them all.

      - whistle
      - arrest_warrant
    description: |
      A member of Tarbean's city watch, tasked with maintaining what little
      order exists in the Commonwealth's capital. Their chainmail is decent
      quality and the city crest is emblazoned on their tabard. While supposed
      to protect citizens, many guards are known to take bribes and look the
      other way. Still, they're well-trained soldiers who can handle themselves
      in a fight. Attack one at your peril.

    description: |
      A thin child with hollow cheeks and oversized eyes, dressed in layers
      of tattered rags. One of countless orphans living rough on Tarbean's
      streets, surviving by begging, stealing, and running errands for those
      who'll pay a copper. Despite their circumstances, there's a sharp
      intelligence in those eyes and a will to survive. They know the city's
      secrets better than most adults.

        help: "If you need to know something about the city, I might know. For a price."

      - salted_fish
      - fishing_net
    description: |
      A weathered merchant with sun-darkened skin and the permanent smell of
      fish. Bren works the docks every morning buying fresh catch, then sells
      it from a market stall until evening. Honest by Tarbean standards, though
      that's not saying much. Will sell fish, basic supplies, and occasionally
      information about the comings and goings at the port.

    description: |
      A middle-aged merchant who coordinates trade caravans between Tarbean
      and other cities across the Commonwealth. Their coat shows the wear of
      countless journeys, and their eyes hold the wariness of someone who's
      fought off bandits more than once. They know the roads, the dangers, and
      which routes are currently safe for travel. A valuable source of
      information for those planning to leave the city.

        travel: "The roads are dangerous. Bandits, wolves, worse things. Best to travel in groups."
        imre: "Imre's about three days journey. The University makes it more civilized than Tarbean."
        job: "I sometimes hire guards for dangerous routes. If you can handle yourself..."
        tarbean: "The capital's a cesspit, but it's where the money flows. Can't avoid it in trade."

    description: |
      A enigmatic figure who commands the loyalty of Tarbean's beggars and
      street urchins. Beneath the layers of carefully arranged rags, there's
      a sharp mind and sharper ambition. The Beggar King knows everything that
      happens on Tarbean's streets - every crime, every secret, every whispered
      conversation. Information is their currency, and they trade it carefully.
      Some say they were once nobility fallen on hard times. Others say they're
      a criminal mastermind. The truth is probably both.

    description: |
      A weathered sailor who's clearly spent their shore leave drinking away
      their wages. They sway unsteadily, singing off-key sea shanties and
      muttering about distant ports. Their clothes are salt-stained and their
      hands rope-burned from years of working the rigging. In between bouts
      of incoherent rambling, they occasionally share surprisingly useful
      information about ships, sea routes, and foreign lands.

        tavern: "Best rum's at the Dockside Inn. Or maybe the Sailor's Rest? They all blur together..."
