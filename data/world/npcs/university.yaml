    description: |
      A young student wearing the grey robe of a novice. They carry an
      armload of books and look perpetually worried about upcoming
      examinations. Like most students, they seem sleep-deprived and
      slightly malnourished from spending their coins on tuition rather
      than food.

      Master Kilvin is an imposing figure, tall and broad-shouldered with
      the build of a blacksmith. His dark skin gleams with sweat from the
      forge's heat. He wears the black master's robe over practical work

  - id: elodin
    name: "Master Elodin, the Namer"
    description: |
      Master Elodin is unlike any other master. Young for his rank, he
      has wild hair and wilder eyes that seem to see beyond the surface
      of things. He wears his master's robes carelessly, often inside-out
      or backwards. His behavior is unpredictable - sometimes profound,
      sometimes seemingly mad. He teaches Naming, the most mysterious and
      dangerous of all the arcane arts.

  - id: master_hemme
    name: "Master Hemme, the Rhetorician"
    description: |
      Master Hemme is a portly man with a perpetually smug expression.
      He wears his master's robes like a badge of superiority, looking
      down his nose at students who dare to speak cleverly. His lectures
      on sympathy theory are dry and punishing. He delights in humiliating
      students who show too much confidence or wit. Many whisper that he
      resents anyone who reminds him of his own limitations.

  - id: master_mandrag
    name: "Master Mandrag, the Alchemist"
    description: |
      Master Mandrag is a gruff, no-nonsense man with stained fingers
      and the perpetual smell of chemicals. His skin is weathered from
      years of exposure to fumes and reagents. He speaks bluntly and
      has no patience for foolishness - alchemy is dangerous work that
      demands precision. Despite his gruff manner, he is fair and
      respects students who show genuine skill and caution.

    description: |
      Master Elxa Dal is a distinguished man with greying temples and
      warm, encouraging eyes. He wears his master's robes with quiet
      dignity. Unlike Hemme, he takes genuine pleasure in teaching and
      watching students grow. His lectures on sympathy are engaging and
      practical. He believes that encouragement produces better results
      than humiliation, though he demands excellence nonetheless.

      diction and perfect grammar. His posture is ramrod straight, and
      he expects the same formality from his students. He teaches
      rhetoric and debate, believing that the ability to argue
      persuasively is essential for any educated person. His standards
      are exacting, but his instruction is excellent.

      history, believing that understanding the past is essential to
      navigating the present. Her memory is legendary - she can recall
