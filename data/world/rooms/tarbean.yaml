      The harbor sprawls before you, a chaotic maze of piers and warehouses
      stretching along the grey water. Ships from across the Commonwealth and
      beyond crowd the docks - merchant vessels, fishing boats, and the
      occasional naval frigate. The air reeks of fish, tar, and salt water.
      Sailors stumble between ships and taverns, while longshoremen haul cargo
      with brutal efficiency. Gulls wheel overhead, screaming for scraps.

      The Waterside slums lie to the west. The Hillside merchant district rises
      to the north. A narrow alley winds east toward abandoned warehouses.

      This is where Tarbean's poorest struggle to survive. Ramshackle buildings
      lean against each other like drunks, their walls stained with years of
      grime and neglect. Narrow alleys twist between them, pooling with
      questionable water when it rains. Ragged children watch from doorways
      with hungry, calculating eyes. The smell of human waste and rotting
      garbage is omnipresent. Those who live here learn quickly: trust no one,
      steal what you need, and never show weakness.

      The docks lie to the east. Beggars Corner is north through the maze of
      alleys. Rooftops beckon above for those quick and desperate enough.

    area: tarbean
    description: |
      The wealthy merchants and minor nobility of Tarbean make their homes on
      the hillside, far enough from the stench of the docks to maintain their
      refined sensibilities. Well-maintained stone buildings line clean
      cobblestone streets. Guards patrol regularly, ensuring the "undesirable
      elements" stay in their proper place below. Shops here sell fine goods
      at prices meant to exclude the poor. The contrast with Waterside is
      stark - two different cities separated by wealth and stone walls.

      The marketplace bustles to the east. The docks sprawl below to the south.
      A guard post stands watch to the northeast.

    name: "Tarbean Marketplace"
    area: tarbean
    description: |
      The central marketplace serves as Tarbean's beating heart, where all
      classes mingle whether they wish to or not. Vendors hawk everything from
      fresh fish to stolen jewelry, their voices competing in a constant
      cacophony. The smell of cooking food mingles with less pleasant odors
      from the nearby tanneries. Pickpockets work the crowds expertly while
      merchants guard their wares with suspicious eyes. The guard post is
      visible to the north, but somehow crimes happen here regardless.

      Hillside lies to the west. Tanners Lane stinks to the south. The Drover
      Lot, where caravans arrive, is southeast. Beggars cluster at the
      southwest corner.

    area: tarbean
    description: |
      The overwhelming stench of the tanning process assaults your senses -
      animal hides soaking in urine, lime, and worse. Workers labor in the
      yards, scraping flesh from skins and working leather in massive vats.
      The ground is stained and slippery with runoff. Even the poorest avoid
      this area unless necessity drives them here. The tanners themselves seem
      immune to the smell, their hands and arms permanently discolored from
      their trade. At least the work is honest, which is more than can be said
      for most occupations in Tarbean.

      The marketplace lies to the north, thankfully upwind.

    description: |
      A large open area where caravans arrive and depart, connecting Tarbean
      to the rest of the Commonwealth. Teamsters tend their horses and oxen
      while merchants negotiate prices and guard their wagons. The ground is
      churned mud mixed with dung, marked by countless wheel ruts. This is
      where news from other cities arrives, carried by traders and travelers.
      The Great Stone Road stretches east toward Imre and the University,
      several days journey through bandit country and worse.

      The marketplace is northwest. The Commonwealth Road leads east toward
      distant Imre.

    area: tarbean
    description: |
      This warehouse has long since been abandoned by legitimate trade, its
      roof partially collapsed and its walls covered in grime. Now it serves
      as shelter for the desperate and meeting place for the dangerous. Broken
      crates and rotting rope litter the floor. The shadows are deep here, and
      movement in the darkness could be rats, street children, or something
      worse. The wind whistles through gaps in the walls, carrying the smell
      of the nearby docks. Those who come here do so carefully, hand on weapon.

      The docks lie to the west. Rooftops provide escape upward for the agile.

    description: |
      Up here, above the filth and danger of the streets, the city takes on a
      different character. Slate roofs and wooden shingles stretch in all
      directions, a landscape only the desperate and skilled navigate. The
      footing is treacherous - one slip means a fall that could cripple or
      kill. But up here the air is cleaner, and you can see trouble coming.
      Street children who survive in Tarbean learn the rooftops early, using
      them to escape pursuers and travel unseen. The view shows the entire
      city: the harbor to the south, wealthy Hillside to the north, and the
      sprawling slums between.

      Careful climbing allows descent to Waterside, the warehouse, or Beggars
      Corner.

    area: tarbean
    description: |
      Where the Waterside slums meet the marketplace, a small square has
      become territory for Tarbean's beggars, orphans, and street children.
      They cluster here, displaying wounds real and fake, pleading for coins
      from market-goers. Some are genuinely desperate; others work for
      organized groups that take a cut of their earnings. The younger children
      huddle together for warmth and protection, their eyes old beyond their
      years. Guards occasionally sweep through to move them along, but they
      always return. This is where you learn to survive on the streets - or
      fail to.

      The marketplace is northeast. Waterside sprawls to the south. Rooftops
      offer escape above.

    area: tarbean
    description: |
      The guard post is a squat stone building with barred windows and a heavy
      door. City guards in leather armor come and go, maintaining what passes
      for law and order in Tarbean. Their jurisdiction seems to extend mainly
      to protecting the wealthy and keeping the poor contained. Wanted notices
      are nailed to a board outside - mostly for thieves, murderers, and those
      who failed to pay their debts. Inside, the guards drink, dice, and
      occasionally venture out on patrol. Justice in Tarbean is a flexible
      concept, heavily influenced by the weight of your purse.

      Hillside lies to the southwest. The marketplace is to the south.

    description: |
      The Great Stone Road stretches east and west, connecting the major cities
      of the Commonwealth. Here at the western end, Tarbean's influence is
      strong - the Drover Lot lies just to the west, busy with caravans. To
      the east, the road winds through farmland and forest for several days
      before reaching Imre and the University. The road itself is well-
      maintained, built centuries ago with skill that modern engineers envy.
      Still, bandits plague this route, and smart travelers move in groups
      with hired guards.

      Tarbean's Drover Lot is west. The road continues east toward Imre.

      The road continues through rolling farmland, marked by ancient stone
      mile markers. Farms and small villages are visible in the distance, but
      the road itself is exposed and lonely. Merchants' caravans pass by
      occasionally, their guards watching the treeline nervously. This stretch
      is notorious for bandits, who strike fast and disappear into the
      countryside. The road is ancient and well-built, but that makes it an
      attractive target - valuable cargo travels these stones.

      The road continues east toward Imre and west toward Tarbean.
