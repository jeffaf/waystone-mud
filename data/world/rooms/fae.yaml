  # The Greystones - Gateway to Fae
  - id: greystones
    name: "The Greystones"
    area: wilderness
    description: |
      A ring of ancient standing stones rises from a hilltop clearing, each
      massive grey pillar worn smooth by countless centuries. The stones are
      arranged in a perfect circle, their surfaces covered in faded carvings
      that seem to shift when you're not looking directly at them. The air
      here feels different - thicker, charged with something ancient and
      watchful.

      At twilight, the space between the stones seems to shimmer, as if the
      boundary between worlds grows thin. Old stories speak of travelers who
      stepped between the stones at the right moment and were never seen again.
      Others speak of the Fae realm that lies just beyond...

      The north road back to Imre lies to the south.

  # The Fae Realm - Twilight Forest
  - id: fae_twilight_forest
    name: "Twilight Forest"
    area: fae
    description: |
      You stand in a forest that exists in eternal twilight. The sky above is
      a swirl of deep purples and burning oranges, neither day nor night but
      something in between. The trees here are impossibly tall, their silver
      bark gleaming with an inner light. Flowers bloom in colors that have no
      names in mortal tongues, and the air carries a sweetness that makes your
      head swim.

      Time moves strangely here. You feel as if you've been walking for hours,
      yet also as if you just arrived. The forest seems to breathe around you,
      watchful and ancient beyond measure.

      A path leads deeper into the twilight, toward something that feels both
      alluring and deeply wrong. The way back to the mortal world shimmers
      behind you.

  # The Cthaeh's Clearing
  - id: fae_cthaeh_clearing
    name: "The Cthaeh's Clearing"
    area: fae
    description: |
      A perfect circle of grass surrounds a single massive tree. Unlike the
      silver-barked trees of the twilight forest, this one is dark and twisted,
      its branches reaching toward the strange sky like grasping fingers. Red
      and black butterflies flutter around its trunk - the only movement in
      this unnaturally still place.

      Something watches you from within the tree. You can feel its attention
      like cold fingers tracing down your spine. This is the Cthaeh - the
      oracle that speaks only truth, yet whose every word brings ruin. The
      Sithe hunt and kill any who speak with it, for its words spread like
      plague through the fabric of fate.

      You should leave. You should turn back now. Yet something holds you
      here, whispering that the answers you seek lie within...

      Type 'speak cthaeh' if you dare. But know that this choice cannot be
      undone. The twilight forest lies to the south.

  # Fae Court (future expansion)
  - id: fae_court_approach
    name: "Approach to the Fae Court"
    area: fae
    description: |
      A path of moonlight solidified into stone leads through gardens of
      impossible beauty. Statues of Fae lords and ladies line the way, so
      lifelike they might step down from their pedestals at any moment.
      Music drifts from somewhere ahead - wild and beautiful and deeply
      unsettling.

      The Court of the Fae lies ahead. Few mortals have seen it and returned
      unchanged.

      [This area is under construction.]
