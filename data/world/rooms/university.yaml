    name: "The University Main Gates"
    area: university
    description: |
      Massive stone gates mark the entrance to the University, the greatest
      center of learning in the Four Corners. Iron-bound oak doors stand open
      during the day, revealing cobblestone paths beyond. Students in various
      colored robes hurry past, clutching books and instruments.

      The Arcanum looms to the north, its spires reaching toward the sky.
      The road to Imre lies to the south across the great stone bridge.

    name: "The University Courtyard"
    area: university
    description: |
      The central courtyard of the University bustles with academic life. Worn
      cobblestones radiate outward to various buildings - the Archives to the
      east, the Medica to the west, and the Masters' Hall to the north. A
      fountain depicting Teccam the Sage occupies the center, its waters
      catching the sunlight. Students gather in small groups, debating theories
      and trading gossip. The Mains and Quad lie to the northwest.

    name: "The University Mews"
    area: university
    description: |
      The Mews houses hundreds of students in narrow stone buildings arranged
      in long rows. Each room is barely large enough for a bed, desk, and
      small wardrobe, yet students personalize them with pride. The smell of
      lamp oil and old books permeates the air. Laundry lines stretch between
      buildings, and the sounds of late-night studying echo through the
      corridors.

    name: "The Archives Entrance"
    area: university
    description: |
      The Archives stand before you, a monument to knowledge itself. Master
      Lorren's domain holds countless books, scrolls, and secrets accumulated
      over centuries. The entrance is flanked by stone pillars carved with
      ancient runes. A stern scriv sits at the admission desk, enforcing the
      strict rules of silence and decorum. Beyond the desk, endless rows of
      shelves disappear into shadow. The main stacks lie to the east.

    name: "The Artificery Workshop"
    area: university
    description: |
      The Artificery is a large workshop filled with workbenches, tools, and
      half-finished projects. The sharp smell of metal and chemicals fills the
      air. Students practice sygaldry here, carefully inscribing runes onto
      metal and glass. Master Kilvin's enormous forge dominates the far wall,
      its heat making the room uncomfortably warm even from this distance.

    name: "The Medica"
    area: university
    description: |
      The Medica smells of herbs, antiseptic, and linen. Rows of clean beds
      line the walls, most empty but a few occupied by students recovering from
      accidents or illness. Shelves hold countless jars of remedies, tinctures,
      and poultices. Master Arwyl and his students move quietly between
      patients, their green robes marking them as healers. A small garden of
      medicinal plants is visible through the eastern windows. The alchemy
      laboratory lies to the south.

    description: |
      The Fishery is where advanced students of the Artificery create wonders.
      Unlike the Artificery above, this workshop is quieter and more focused.
      Completed sympathy lamps line the shelves, their soft glow requiring no
      fuel. Half-finished projects cover the workbenches - gear assemblies,
      inscribed metal plates, and mysterious devices. The walls are covered
      with complex sygaldry diagrams and Master Kilvin's notes.

    name: "The Masters' Hall"
    area: university
    description: |
      The Masters' Hall is an imposing stone building where the Nine Masters
      conduct University business. High-arched windows let in natural light
      that illuminates portraits of past masters. The admissions chamber lies
      beyond the heavy oak doors - it is here that students face the terror of
      Advanced Sympathy examinations and tuition hearings. Few students linger
      here without good reason. The Hollows and Rookery connect to the west and north.

    name: "The Crockery"
    area: university
    description: |
      The Crockery serves as the University's facility for students suffering
      from mental distress - though its name suggests a darker, less
      compassionate time. The building is quiet and isolated, with small rooms
      designed for rest and recovery. A few staff members tend to patients with
      gentle efficiency. Most students speak of the Crockery in whispers,
      hoping never to need its services.

    area: university
    description: |
      A nondescript door leads down to the Underthing - the vast network of
      tunnels and forgotten chambers beneath the University. Most students
      don't even know this entrance exists, hidden as it is behind old storage
      rooms. The stairs descend into darkness, and a faint smell of dampness
      and old stone drifts up from below. Strange sounds echo in the depths.

    area: university
    description: |
      The Hollows serves as the University's administrative heart. Here students
      register for classes, pay tuition, and face the dreaded admissions board.
      Clerks sit behind worn wooden desks, shuffling papers and stamping forms.
      The walls display portraits of past Chancellors and notices about upcoming
      examinations. A sense of bureaucratic dread permeates the air.

    area: university
    description: |
      The Mains is a sprawling complex of lecture halls and classrooms where
      most University instruction takes place. Stone corridors connect dozens
      of rooms of varying sizes, from intimate seminar spaces to grand halls
      that can seat hundreds. The walls are thick with slate boards covered in
      half-erased formulas and diagrams. Students hurry between classes,
      clutching notes and textbooks.

    description: |
      The largest classroom in the University, with tiered wooden benches
      rising in semicircular rows toward the back. A raised dais at the front
      holds the lecturer's podium and demonstration table. Gas lamps line the
      walls, their light reflected by polished brass fixtures. This hall hosts
      major lectures and public examinations. The wooden benches are worn
      smooth by generations of students.

    description: |
      Master Brandeur's domain - a formal hall designed for debate and oratory.
      Rows of benches face a central speaking platform. The acoustics are
      perfect; even a whisper carries clearly. Tapestries depicting famous
      debates and orators line the walls. Students practice their arguments here,
      preparing for the verbal duels that academic life requires.

    area: university
    description: |
      Endless rows of shelves stretch into darkness, holding thousands upon
      thousands of books. The silence is absolute - the scrivs enforce it with
      iron discipline. Sympathy lamps provide soft illumination without the fire
      risk of candles. The air is dry to preserve the ancient texts. Ladders on
      rails allow access to upper shelves that reach toward the vaulted ceiling.

    description: |
      The deepest level of the Archives, accessible only to those Master Lorren
      deems worthy. Here lie the most dangerous texts - books on forbidden
      knowledge, sealed grimoires, and documents too sensitive for general
      access. Iron gates bar entry, and a scriv stands eternal watch. The very
      air feels heavy with secrets. Few students ever see this place.

    description: |
      The private offices and quarters of the Nine Masters occupy this ancient
      stone tower. Each Master has their own chamber, though the doors are
      usually closed to students without appointments. A narrow spiral staircase
      winds upward, past doors marked with brass nameplates. The tower's name
      comes from the ravens that nest in its upper reaches - birds as old as
      the University itself, some say.

    description: |
      Master Mandrag's laboratory fills the air with strange smells - sulfur,
      quicksilver, and compounds less identifiable. Rows of workbenches hold
      glassware in every shape: retorts, alembics, flasks, and tubes. Small
      flames burn beneath simmering mixtures. Cabinets along the walls hold
      reagents in labeled jars. Students work carefully here, knowing that one
      mistake could be explosive.

      A grassy quadrangle provides a rare open space amid the University's
      stone buildings. Ancient oak trees shade wooden benches where students
      study in good weather. A cobblestone path crosses diagonally, worn smooth
      by countless feet. In spring, the quad fills with students enjoying the
      sunshine between classes. Even now, a few students sit reading or engaged
      in quiet conversation.
