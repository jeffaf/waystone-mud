    description: |
      The great Stonebridge spans the wide Omethi River, connecting the
      University to the town of Imre. Built from massive grey stones fitted so
      perfectly that no mortar was needed, it has stood for centuries. The
      river rushes far below, and you can see fishing boats and barges making
      their way upstream. Students cross constantly, heading to Imre's taverns,
      shops, and entertainments.

      The University gates stand to the north. Imre's main square lies to the
      south.

  - id: imre_main_square
    name: "Imre Main Square"
    area: imre
    description: |
      Imre's main square bustles with activity day and night. A grand fountain
      dominates the center, depicting the founding of the town with detailed
      stonework. Market stalls line the edges, selling everything from fresh
      bread to questionable "magical" trinkets. Street performers entertain
      crowds while pickpockets work the distracted audience. The famous Eolian
      music house stands to the east, while various shops and taverns branch
      off in all directions.

      A dusty training yard lies to the west. A dark alley runs behind the
      shops to the southwest. The north road leads out of town.

    name: "The Eolian"
    area: imre
    description: |
      The Eolian is the finest music hall in Imre - perhaps in all the
      Commonwealth. Rich wood paneling and excellent acoustics make this the
      premier venue for musicians seeking to make their name. A small stage
      dominates one end, where performers can attempt to earn their talent
      pipes if they're brave enough. The crowd here is discerning and
      sometimes cruel. Elegant tables fill the room, and the scent of good
      wine and expensive pipe smoke hangs in the air.

    name: "Devi's Gaelet"
    area: imre
    description: |
      Devi's establishment is reached by climbing a narrow staircase to the
      third floor of an otherwise unremarkable building. The room is small but
      well-appointed, with comfortable chairs and locked cabinets containing
      her business records. Devi herself is a former student expelled from the
      Arcanum, now making her living as a gaelet - a money lender. Her rates
      are steep but fair, and she has a reputation for both discretion and
      ruthlessness when collecting debts.

    name: "The Waystone Inn"
    area: imre
    description: |
      The Waystone Inn is a quiet, respectable establishment tucked away from
      the busier parts of Imre. Unlike the rowdy taverns near the square, this
      inn caters to travelers and students seeking a peaceful place to rest.
      The common room features a large fireplace, comfortable chairs, and the
      scent of good cooking from the kitchen. A few travelers sit at the bar,
      sharing road stories. The innkeeper maintains strict rules against
      fighting and excessive noise.

  - id: imre_training_yard
    name: "Training Yard"
    area: imre
    description: |
      A dusty practice yard behind the main square, surrounded by a low wooden
      fence. Several training dummies stand in various states of repair, and
      weapon racks line the walls with practice swords and staffs. A few
      students spar with each other while others practice forms alone. A
      weathered sign reads: "Practice here. Fight for real elsewhere."

      This is a good place for new adventurers to practice combat without
      risking their lives.

  - id: imre_back_alley
    name: "Dark Back Alley"
    area: imre
    description: |
      A narrow, shadowy alley behind the main square's shops. The buildings
      loom overhead, blocking most of the light. Refuse and broken crates
      litter the ground, and the smell is... unpleasant. A rusty grate in the
      ground leads down into the sewers. This is the kind of place where
      unsavory deals happen and where rats grow fat on garbage.

      The main square is visible to the north.

  - id: imre_sewers_entrance
    name: "Sewer Entrance"
    area: imre
    description: |
      The air here is thick with the smell of stagnant water and decay. A
      narrow brick tunnel stretches into darkness, with murky water running
      along a channel in the center. The occasional squeak and splash from
      deeper in the sewers hints at what lives down here. Most sensible
      people avoid the sewers, but the rats here are known to carry small
      valuables they've scavenged from above.

      A ladder leads back up to the alley.

    name: "Sewer Junction"
    area: imre
    description: |
      A wider chamber where several sewer tunnels converge. The water here
      is deeper and the smell is worse. Rats scurry along the edges, their
      eyes glinting in the darkness. Old bones and debris have collected
      against the walls. This is definitely not a place for the faint of
      heart, but adventurers seeking to prove themselves often come here to
      hunt the giant rats that infest these tunnels.

  - id: imre_north_road
    name: "North Road"
    area: imre
    description: |
      The road leading north from Imre toward distant towns. The cobblestones
      give way to packed dirt as civilization fades behind you. Travelers
      occasionally pass by, but this stretch of road is known to attract
      bandits who prey on unwary merchants and students. The fields on either
      side offer little cover, making it easy to see trouble coming - if
      you're paying attention.

      A barely-visible path winds northeast toward a hilltop where ancient
      standing stones can be glimpsed against the sky. Local folk avoid that
      place, especially at twilight.

      Imre's main square lies to the south.
