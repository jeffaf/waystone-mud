      The great Stonebridge spans the wide Omethi River, connecting the
      University to the town of Imre. Built from massive grey stones fitted so
      perfectly that no mortar was needed, it has stood for centuries. The
      river rushes far below, and you can see fishing boats and barges making
      their way upstream. Students cross constantly, heading to Imre's taverns,
      shops, and entertainments.

      The University gates stand to the north. Imre's main square lies to the
      south.

    name: "Imre Main Square"
    area: imre
    description: |
      Imre's main square bustles with activity day and night. A grand fountain
      dominates the center, depicting the founding of the town with detailed
      stonework. Market stalls line the edges, selling everything from fresh
      bread to questionable "magical" trinkets. Street performers entertain
      crowds while pickpockets work the distracted audience. The famous Eolian
      music house stands to the east, while various shops and taverns branch
      off in all directions.

    name: "The Eolian"
    area: imre
    description: |
      The Eolian is the finest music hall in Imre - perhaps in all the
      Commonwealth. Rich wood paneling and excellent acoustics make this the
      premier venue for musicians seeking to make their name. A small stage
      dominates one end, where performers can attempt to earn their talent
      pipes if they're brave enough. The crowd here is discerning and
      sometimes cruel. Elegant tables fill the room, and the scent of good
      wine and expensive pipe smoke hangs in the air.

  - id: imre_devi_shop
    name: "Devi's Gaelet"
    area: imre
    description: |
      Devi's establishment is reached by climbing a narrow staircase to the
      third floor of an otherwise unremarkable building. The room is small but
      well-appointed, with comfortable chairs and locked cabinets containing
      her business records. Devi herself is a former student expelled from the
      Arcanum, now making her living as a gaelet - a money lender. Her rates
      are steep but fair, and she has a reputation for both discretion and
      ruthlessness when collecting debts.

    name: "The Waystone Inn"
    area: imre
    description: |
      The Waystone Inn is a quiet, respectable establishment tucked away from
      the busier parts of Imre. Unlike the rowdy taverns near the square, this
      inn caters to travelers and students seeking a peaceful place to rest.
      The common room features a large fireplace, comfortable chairs, and the
      scent of good cooking from the kitchen. A few travelers sit at the bar,
      sharing road stories. The innkeeper maintains strict rules against
      fighting and excessive noise.
